\begin{abstract}
Multifrequency media access control has been well understood in
general wireless ad hoc networks, while in wireless sensor networks,
researchers still focus on single frequency solutions. In wireless
sensor networks, each device is typically equipped with a single
radio transceiver and applications adopt much smaller packet sizes
compared to those in general wireless ad hoc networks. Hence, the
multifrequency MAC protocols proposed for general wireless ad hoc
networks are not suitable for wireless sensor network applications,
which we further demonstrate through our simulation experiments. In
this article, we propose MMSN, which takes advantage of
multifrequency availability while, at the same time, takes into
consideration the restrictions of wireless sensor networks. Through
extensive experiments, MMSN exhibits the prominent ability to utilize
parallel transmissions among neighboring nodes. When multiple physical
frequencies are available, it also achieves increased energy
efficiency, demonstrating the ability to work against radio
interference and the tolerance to a wide range of measured time
synchronization errors.

\section{Introduction}


As a new technology, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has a wide
range of applications \cite{Culler-01, Bahl-02, Akyildiz-01}, including
environment monitoring, smart buildings, medical care, industrial and
military applications. Among them, a recent trend is to develop
commercial sensor networks that require pervasive sensing of both
environment and human beings, for example, assisted living
\cite{Akyildiz-02, Harvard-01,CROSSBOW} and smart homes
\cite{Harvard-01, Adya-01,CROSSBOW}.

  ``For these applications, sensor devices are incorporated into human
  cloths \cite{Natarajan-01, Zhou-06, Bahl-02, Adya-01} for monitoring
  health related information like EKG readings, fall detection, and
  voice recognition''.
