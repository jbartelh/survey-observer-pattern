\section{Introduction}

	In contrast to traditional batch mode programs modern applications are reactive and event driven. 
	examples like the GUI 
	reactive is hard and errorprone, dealing with continuous event occourance and user input requires a considerable amount of engineering.
	
	quote an Adobe presentation from 2007~\cite{parent2006possible} on current production systems:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1/3 of the code in Adobe’s desktop applications is devoted to event handling logic	
		\item 1/2 of the bugs reported during a product cycle exist in this code
	\end{itemize}


	
	A programming paradigm well suited for these event-driven and interative applications is reactive programming
	reactive programming gained popularity

	early approach in reactive programming is the use of the observer Pattern
	
	\subsection{UI Event handling}



	in the paper ``Deprecating the Observer Pattern'' the authors criticize the use of the observer pattern for reactive programs,
	the title already is a hard claim by itself.



\section{Observer Pattern}
	\cite{Gamma:1995}

	\subsection{Violations of software engineering principles}
		In \cite{Maier:2012} it is shown by means of code exmple that the observer pattern violates a set of software engineering principles.
		The violated principles are:

		\subsubsection{Side-effects}
			Often several observers are used to implement a single Operation,
			%e.g. a \lstinline|onClick| and a \lstinline|onRelease| observer are necessary to implement a drag and drop operation.
			Therefore, the observer patterns promote side-effects and already on the API level.

		\subsubsection{Encapsulation}
			In many cases multiple observers are used to simulate a state machine. 
			The state, e.g. a dragged object, is stored in a variables within a shared scope.
			As this broader scope of these shared variables escapes the scope of the observers, the observer pattern violates the encapsulation principle.
			
		\subsubsection{Composability}

		\subsubsection{Resource management}

		\subsubsection{Separation of concerns}

		\subsubsection{Data consistency}

		\subsubsection{Uniformity}

		\subsubsection{Abstraction}

		\subsubsection{Semantic distance}

\section{Reactive programming}

	\subsection{Functional reactive programming (FRP)}

		first in functional languages by~\cite{Elliott}

		signals behaviour~\cite{Bainomugisha:2013}
	

\section{Scala.React}

	\subsection{First class events}

	\subsection{Reactor}

	\subsection{Embedded dataflow langugage}

\section{Evolution of reactive programming frameworks}

	with lambda-expressions and stream java added data-flow elements to the language for more declarative programming
	added in java 8 and already extended in java 9

	\subsection{Reactive databinding}

		Font-end frameworks inspired by the Flapjax reactive language~\cite{Meyerovich:2009}

		Metor example: ~\cite{hochhaus2016meteor}

		based on fl

	\subsection{Reactive streams}
